# FlaskRPG

A front end client built for a Flask API server demonstrating a room generation algorithm in a game appropriately named... FlaskRPG. Source code for the Flask API can be found [here](https://github.com/Team-Big-Bosses/CS-Build-Week-1-Flask).

## About

This application was written in React with Redux for state management. The Canvas API was used to animate the player sprite walking. All game art/creative assets were taken from opengameart.org with gratitude.
